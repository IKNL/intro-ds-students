# # 02 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Perform some EDA on the synthetic data

# ## 2.1 Read the data
# Read the data file that you generated in the previous notebook (`01_preprocessing`)

# ## 2.2 Perform EDA
# Pretty straightforward. Some of the things that would be interesting to see:
#
# * A random sample of 5 rows of the `DataFrame`
# * Descriptive statistics of all features
#    - E.g., mean, median, SD, IQR, etc.
# * Correlation across features in a heatmap
# * Visualizations of the distribution of all features. This is super
# important, since we can learn a lot from this type of plots. Make sure that
# you choose the right type of plot for each feature (e.g., you probably
# have to treat continuous and categorical features differently).
#
# Make sure you save all your plots in the `results` directory
#
# **Tip**: take a look at [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
# **Tip**: get some inspiration from the [Python Graph Gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/)

# What conclusions can you draw from the EDA? What considerations should you
# have for further analysis of the data?
