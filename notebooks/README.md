# Notebooks

I strongly recommend you use [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) to work in your Jupyter notebooks. However, choose the approach that is more comfortable for you.

1. [`01_preprocessing`](./01_preprocessing.ipynb)
1. [`02_eda`](./02_eda.ipynb)
1. [`03_survival_analysis`](./03_survival_analysis.ipynb)
