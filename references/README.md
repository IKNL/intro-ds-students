References
==============================

Some important references to get you started:

* [`gospodarowicz2017tnm`](./gospodarowicz2017tnm.pdf)<br>
Nice introduction to the basics of TNM classification. I recommend you go through the whole Introduction and the chapter corresponding to the tumor type of interest.
* [`wang2019machine`](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3214306)<br>
Good overview of survival analysis with especial focus in ML/AI techniques.

If you are having problems accessing any of these references, please contact your supervisor.
